        CacheManager Configuration
        ==========================
        An ehcache.xml corresponds to a single CacheManager.

        See instructions below or the ehcache schema (ehcache.xsd) on how to configure.

        System property tokens can be specified in this file which are replaced when the configuration
        is loaded. For example multicastGroupPort=${multicastGroupPort} can be replaced with the
        System property either from an environment variable or a system property specified with a
        command line switch such as -DmulticastGroupPort=4446. Another example, useful for Terracotta
        server based deployments is <terracottaConfig url="${serverAndPort}"/ and specify a command line
        switch of -Dserver36:9510

        The attributes of <ehcache> are:
        * name - an optional name for the CacheManager.  The name is optional and primarily used
        for documentation or to distinguish Terracotta clustered cache state.  With Terracotta
        clustered caches, a combination of CacheManager name and cache name uniquely identify a
        particular cache store in the Terracotta clustered memory.
        * updateCheck - an optional boolean flag specifying whether this CacheManager should check
        for new versions of Ehcache over the Internet.  If not specified, updateCheck="true".
        * dynamicConfig - an optional setting that can be used to disable dynamic configuration of caches
        associated with this CacheManager.  By default this is set to true - i.e. dynamic configuration
        is enabled.  Dynamically configurable caches can have their TTI, TTL and maximum disk and
        in-memory capacity changed at runtime through the cache's configuration object.
        * monitoring - an optional setting that determines whether the CacheManager should
        automatically register the SampledCacheMBean with the system MBean server.

        Currently, this monitoring is only useful when using Terracotta clustering and using the
        Terracotta Developer Console. With the "autodetect" value, the presence of Terracotta clustering
        will be detected and monitoring, via the Developer Console, will be enabled. Other allowed values
        are "on" and "off".  The default is "autodetect". This setting does not perform any function when
        used with JMX monitors.

        * maxBytesLocalHeap - optional setting that constraints the memory usage of the Caches managed by the CacheManager
        to use at most the specified number of bytes of the local VM's heap.
        * maxBytesLocalOffHeap - optional setting that constraints the offHeap usage of the Caches managed by the CacheManager
        to use at most the specified number of bytes of the local VM's offHeap memory.
        * maxBytesLocalDisk - optional setting that constraints the disk usage of the Caches managed by the CacheManager
        to use at most the specified number of bytes of the local disk.

        These settings let you define "resource pools", caches will share. For instance setting maxBytesLocalHeap to 100M, will result in
        all caches sharing 100 MegaBytes of ram. The CacheManager will balance these 100 MB across all caches based on their respective usage
        patterns. You can allocate a precise amount of bytes to a particular cache by setting the appropriate maxBytes* attribute for that cache.
        That amount will be subtracted from the CacheManager pools, so that if a cache a specified 30M requirement, the other caches will share
        the remaining 70M.

        Also, specifying a maxBytesLocalOffHeap at the CacheManager level will result in overflowToOffHeap to be true by default. If you don't want
        a specific cache to overflow to off heap, you'll have to set overflowToOffHeap="false" explicitly

        Here is an example of CacheManager level resource tuning, which will use up to 400M of heap and 2G of offHeap:

        <ehcache xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                 xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="ehcache.xsd"
                 updateCheck="true" monitoring="autodetect"
                 dynamicConfig="true" maxBytesLocalHeap="400M" maxBytesLocalOffHeap="2G">

        -->
<ehcache xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="ehcache.xsd"
         updateCheck="false" monitoring="off" dynamicConfig="true">

    <defaultCache maxEntriesLocalHeap="0" eternal="false" timeToIdleSeconds="1200" timeToLiveSeconds="1200">
    </defaultCache>

    <cache name="wiktcache" maxEntriesLocalHeap="1000" eternal="true" memoryStoreEvictionPolicy="FIFO"/>

</ehcache>
